# Overheid-data-API

An API which requests a dataset from the CBS, and then displays specific data from the dataset in a graph.

Data is taken from https://data.overheid.nl/

This API program specifically collects data from a dataset concerning incarceration numbers in the Netherlands from 2005 to 2022.
The program first asks the user to select a gender and an age group, and is then presented with the incarceration numbers, filtered according to the choices the user made.
The program also saves the data to a .csv file.
A secondary program is able to create a graph from the data stored in the .csv file generated by the main program.

Lastly, values.py was written in order to obtain the raw values of the dataset. These values were then used in the main program.
